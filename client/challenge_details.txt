Create a simple Todo Dashboard component in React that allows users to:
    1. Add a new todo item (with title and optional description).
    2. Mark a todo as complete/incomplete.
    3. Filter todos by “All”, “Active”, or “Completed”.

Requirements:
    1. Use functional components and hooks (useState, useEffect).
    2. Use CSS-in-JS or inline styles (no CSS files).
    3. All todos should have:
        i. { id, title, description, isDone }
    4. Clean UI layout, nothing fancy.

Tools to learn:
    1. learn "localStorage" so that todos persist even if the page gets refreshed.
    2. learn widely used and famous tools or libraries so that the todos (items) can be dragged

Bonus (+5 pts):
    1. Add a search bar that filters todos in real time.

Tools/Libraries used: (to be filled in later when this challenge is finished)
    1.
